# MapSwipe

Welcome to the Mapswipe app. This is the app that is distributed through mapswipe.org as well as through the Play and Apple stores. It was initially developed by Doctors without Borders as part of the Missing Maps project. 

## Please use the dev branch

We are in the middle of a major rewrite of the app. Please look at the [`dev` branch](https://github.com/mapswipe/mapswipe/tree/dev) for up-to-date information until all changes are merged back into `master`.
